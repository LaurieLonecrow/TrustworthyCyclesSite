This is a site I am in the process of building.  It is for a motorcycle parts picker who buys and sells parts and other weird stuff.  His request was to create a simple site, "nothing fancy, and nothing that the old guys can't understand". This is an excercise in working with a client and creating a responsive website.  I use Bootstrap for styling.  This site can be viewed here: https://laurielonecrow.github.io/TrustworthyCyclesSite/
