This is a basic site I am in the process of building.  It is for a motorcycle parts picker who buys and sells parts and other weird stuff.  His request was to create a simple site, "nothing fancy, and nothing that the old guys can't understand". This is an excercise in working with a client, creating a responsive website, and building a clean looking html and css front-end.

I use Bootstrap for responsive styling.
